# JS-Scout ðŸ”­

A simple and fast command-line tool to perform reconnaissance on JavaScript files. Developed by Triage Security Labs.

`JS-Scout` automates the tedious process of finding and analyzing JavaScript files associated with a web application, extracting potential API endpoints, secrets, and other valuable information for security researchers.

### Features

- **JS File Discovery:** Crawls a target URL to find all linked JavaScript files.
- **Pattern Matching:** Scans JS content for common patterns:
  - API endpoints and paths (`/api/v1`, `/internal/`, etc.).
  - Other subdomains and URLs.
  - Potential secrets and sensitive keywords (`token`, `secret`, `api_key`).
- **Concurrent Analysis:** Uses multithreading to analyze multiple files quickly.
- **Clean & Structured Output:** Presents findings in a clear, organized format.
- **Supports Multiple Targets:** Scan a single URL or provide a list of URLs from a file.
